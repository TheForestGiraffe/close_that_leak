# Memory Workshop Exercise — “Works… Until It Doesn’t”

## Goal

This program compiles and runs.

At first glance, it looks correct.

But its output is **not** always what we expect.

Your task is to:

1. Observe the behaviour
2. Explain *why* it happens
3. Propose a correct and robust fix

You are **not allowed to add printfs randomly or rewrite the whole program**.  
Work from reasoning and from the concepts we discussed in the workshop.

## ▶️ How to run

Use the provided script:

```bash
./compile_and_run.sh
